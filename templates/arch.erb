# An optional global directive is available when building a split
# package. pkgbase is used to refer to the group of packages in the
# output of makepkg and in the naming of source-only tarballs. If not
# specified, the first element in the pkgname array is used. The
# variable is not allowed to begin with a hyphen. All values for split
# packages default to the global ones given in the
# PKGBUILD. Everything, except makedepends, #Sources, and #Integrity
# variables can be overridden within each split package's package()
# function.
